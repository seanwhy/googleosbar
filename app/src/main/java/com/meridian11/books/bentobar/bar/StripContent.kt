/**
 * Whether the strip has anything on the screen. One rule, used by [BarController] for its window: never from how many
 * entries it has, because an entry can draw nothing (a spacer without its line, a text item shown as an icon it doesn't
 * have). An empty strip's window is made invisible rather than left up as a transparent one, which is what Play Protect's
 * threat detection flagged (AGENTS.md); the window keeps its exact width and keeps being measured. Pure, so the rule is
 * unit-tested; what an item draws here is what [ItemView] draws.
